# chs-studentbostader-api
A simple and very lightweight solution for accesing the different services found on [Chalmers](https://www.chalmersstudentbostader.se/) Studentbost√§der mina sidor through a REST API. Its purpose is to simplify the creation of apps and services by wrapping around the clunky GUI found on the website as well as the closed source API and hardware provided by Aptus Assa Abloy used to book laundry rooms, open doors, check status of rent etc.
